1.step1_create_flood_depth_raster.ipynb
- Use inundation values from report and project inundation depths 

2. step2_create_wave_height_raster.ipynb 
Use the merged flood depth tiffs, wave heights from figure 10 and create the wave height
tiffs 

3.step3_create_polygon_dem.ipynb
- attempt to make the polygon using python code (Did not use this and effectively
use arcmap)

4.  step4_log_fit_check.ipynb
